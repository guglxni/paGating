**Key Findings**:
1. ‚úÖ **Infrastructure validated**: All components working correctly
2. ‚úÖ **Consistent improvement**: Both training and validation losses decreasing steadily
3. ‚úÖ **Reproducible setup**: Docker, requirements, and data pipeline functional
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resource constraints**: Training requires significant disk space and time

## Phase 2: paGating Comparative Studies ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
