# paGating: Parametric Adaptive Gating Activations for Deep Learning

## Overview
paGating is a PyTorch library implementing various parametric adaptive gating activation functions including paGLU, paGTU, paSwishU, and paReGLU. These activations offer learnable parameters that adapt during training for improved model performance.

## Features
- Core implementations of multiple adaptive gating activations
- Alpha parameter scheduling utilities
- Example models with paGating units
- Training and benchmarking scripts
- CoreML export capabilities for Apple Neural Engine deployment

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Check the `experiments` directory for example usage with CIFAR and transformer models.
